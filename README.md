![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300?text=News+Summarization+and+TTS+Application)

## Overview
This project is a web-based application that extracts news articles for a given company, performs sentiment analysis, and summarizes the content in English. Additionally, each articleâ€™s concise summary is translated into Hindi and then combined to generate a Hindi audio report using text-to-speech (TTS). The final solution includes a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, API integration, and deployment on Hugging Face Spaces.

## Features
- **News Extraction:** Scrapes article titles, summaries, and publication dates from at least 10 unique news articles using BeautifulSoup.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifies articles as Positive, Negative, or Neutral using Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Summarization:** Generates concise summaries for each article.
- **Translation and TTS:** Translates each article's concise summary from English to Hindi and combines them to generate a Hindi audio report.
- **User Interface:** Provides a clean, responsive web interface built with Streamlit.
- **API Development:** Exposes backend functionality via APIs (see `api.py`).
- **Deployment:** Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces for public testing.
